### How to contribute

If you wish to contribute to the website the process is pretty simple.

1. Fork and clone the repository (an example can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
2. Create a new branch for your changes (warning, this step cannot be done in RStudio!)
3. Make your changes. You can build and view your local version by using `rmarkdown::render_site()`
4. When you are done, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your changes might not appear on the public site right away as we have a development version for making sure changes don't break the site.
