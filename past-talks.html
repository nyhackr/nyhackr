Using the ‘Botometer’ algorithm, I assessed the proportion of bot accounts engaging with tweets from 382 U.S. Congress members on Twitter.<\/p><p><strong>About Manu:<\/strong>I am a computational social scientist and doctoral candidate in Political Science at Columbia University, specializing in Comparative Politics and Statistical Methodology. My research leverages advanced techniques in causal inference, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics to explore political behavior and social media dynamics. My work has earned recognition, including the 2023 Best Student Paper Award in Information, Technology, and Politics and an early career fellowship from the American Political Science Association. Before graduate school, I was a Research Specialist II at Princeton University’s Empirical Studies of Conflict project and a Predictive Analytics Fellow at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<\/p><p><strong>Improving Survey Experiments with Pre-Post Designs:<\/strong>Grow Progress has run well over a thousand survey experiments on behalf of our politics and advocacy clients in the 2024 cycle. This type of pre-testing creative before a broader rollout is increasingly a best practice in campaign work, with most major campaigns, party bodies, and large PACs extensively testing their ads. In this talk, I’ll share some internal research clarifying which experiments tend to benefit most from these designs.<\/p><p><strong>About Andy:<\/strong>Andy is a senior data scientist at Grow Progress, where he works on GP’s platform for fast, cost-effective, and easily interpretable message testing. Some recurring themes of his work are modern methods for survey weighting, efficient estimation of causal effects, and scalable Bayesian inference.<\/p><p><strong>Deciphering News Article Engagement in the Digital Era: Insights into Public Sentiment through Supervised Machine Learning Models:<\/strong>2020 was marked with a series of unprecedented events, such as the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and the crucial 2020 U.S. presidential election. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2020, a little over half of the respondents (53%) claim that they got their news from social media and digital platforms. Thus, an increasing number of individuals actively participated in discussions on various platforms, including commenting on media platforms. As discussions around these events proliferated across social media and news outlets, understanding the factors driving the popularity of articles became paramount. Articles were collected from The NY Times to understand what features influence popularity. Supervised machine learning models, including linear, ridge, lasso, random forest, and gradient boosting regressions, were employed.<\/p><p><strong>Anusha Natarajan:<\/strong>Anusha Natarajan is currently a graduate student at Columbia University, studying quantitative methods in the social sciences with a data science focus. She is passionate about bringing in the social and data science worlds together to make sense of the data visually and statistically. Anusha has conducted social science research quantitatively and qualitatively inside and outside the university. In her undergraduate years, she took data driven approaches to improve student voter registration and voting rates in implementing reforms to improve STEM voter rates in the 2020 election. She worked as an intern at the Pew Research Center, researching voter trends across.<\/p><p>Doors open at <strong>6:30 PM America/New_York<\/strong> with <strong><a href=\"https://nyhackr.org/pizza.html?utm_source=nyhackr\">pizza<\/a><\/strong>.

However when it comes to describing the what and how of ML systems, we appear to have a disembodied perspective of a black box. In this talk, running around 35 minutes, I describe a few accompanying perspective traps that lead to such mental models. I go on to show how ML models are interconnected with software applications, some of the hard engineering designs and consequent technical debt. In short, a preview into ML in practice and the engineering considerations and labor that go into building useful ML systems. This talk will be helpful for folks attempting to build/learn about practical data hygienic ML systems.<\/p><p><strong>About Vikram:<\/strong>I am a Sr. ML engineer with experience in ranking and recommendation algorithms, segmentation techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and heterogeneous treatment effect/causal modeling within large communities/social networks at Meta. I am experienced in research areas such as Bayesian neural networks, and causal inference, with explorations of reinforcement learning techniques. I am a published author in niche technology areas, with a strong background in mentoring and team building. I am a regular speaker on industrial use of machine learning and practical algorithmic techniques at academia.

This is especially true when practitioners turn to heuristic methods like trimming to improve weights. After reviewing the basic raking algorithm and showing some examples in R, I’ll show that survey weighting can also be understood as an optimization problem, one which allows for explicit regularization. In addition to providing a conceptually crisp view of what (vanilla) raking optimizes for, I’ll show that this regularized raking (implemented via the rsw python package) can allow for more fine-grained control over weights distributions, and ultimately more accurate weighted estimates. Examples will be drawn from US elections surveys.<\/p><p><strong>About Andy:<\/strong>Andy is a data scientist who enjoys using modern statistical and machine learning methods to more efficiently solve social science flavored problems (like survey weighting!).

Propensity score analysis (PSA) attempts to adjust selection bias that occurs due to the lack of randomization. Analysis is typically conducted in three phases. In phase I, the probability of placement in the treatment is estimated to identify matched pairs, clusters, or probability weights. In phase II, comparisons on the dependent variable can be made between matched pairs, within clusters, or using inverse probability weights in regression models. In phase III, sensitivity analysis is conducted to estimate how robust the effect sizes estimated in phase II are to unobserved confounders. R (R Core Team, 2012) is ideal for conducting PSA given its wide availability of the most current statistical methods vis-à-vis add-on packages as well as its superior graphics capabilities. This talk will provide participants with a theoretical overview of propensity score methods with an emphasis on graphics. A survey of R packages for conducting PSA with multilevel data, non-binary treatments, and bootstrapping will also be provided. Lastly, a Shiny application to assist with all three phases of PSA will be demonstrated.<\/p><p><strong>About Jason:<\/strong>Dr. Jason Bryer is currently an Assistant Professor and Associate Director in the Data Science and Information Systems department at the City University of New York.

From the beginning, data structures, file systems and memory mapping have allowed for low cost and scalable ways to do fast analysis on domain specific data. The &quot;trick&quot; is recognizing the algorithms and structures that most databases employ are already available in your favorite language. In this talk I will pull the curtain back on the important parts of a database, show how these are not magic but merely code and ideas, and then show how you can build high performance data layers that are problem specific - no longer requiring you to rely on the limits of a general purpose solution. I&#39;ll introduce basic database structure and design, how they work and how they get their speed. I&#39;ll then expand on these ideas using R, including examples from cosmological data, a few examples of rolling your own custom structures, and an introduction to a new(er) R package called “indexing”, which is an out-of-core data.frame able to work with very large data sets efficiently outside of RAM using syntax that looks like R---because it is.<\/p> <p><strong>About Jeff:<\/strong><br/>Jeff has spent the last two decades working in quantitative finance. Beginning a career as an option market maker on the floor of the CBOE, he went on to build quantitative software for trading. Releasing a series of packages for the R programming language in the mid 2000s, this software became the foundation of many future tools and efforts adopted across the industry. After giving a talk at an early quant conference in Switzerland he decided that a conference in the United States was required. He co-founded <a href=\"https://www.rinfinance.com/?utm_source=nyhackr\">R/Finance<\/a> in Chicago in 2009 and with its success, an amazing community around better software thrived. During this time, Jeff was actively consulting to technology driven hedge funds and proprietary trading firms. He was also laying the groundwork for multiple startups around data and time series management. His work in the field is referenced in more than 100 books, journals and courses around the world. In 2013 he joined Citadel’s then new Quantitative Strategies desk---where he was responsible for many of the early research tools around data processing, alpha validation, risk management and high performance computing. He left Citadel in 2019, after watching the desk grow from its first trade to become one of the most successful quant teams in the world. Reemerging from a garden leave in Summer of 2020, he is once again back to building the tools he hopes will power the next twenty years of quantitative trading.<\/p> <p>The venue doors open at <strong>5:30 PM America/New_York<\/strong> where we will resume <strong><a href=\"https://nyhackr.org/pizza.html?utm_source=nyhackr\">enjoying pizza<\/a><\/strong> together (we encourage the virtual audience to have pizza as well).

More information about their program is below.<\/p> <p><strong>About the Talk:<\/strong><br/>Pandera is a data validation and testing tool for dataframes in the Python ecosystem… but can it be used to validate R data.frames? This is the question we will attempt to answer in this talk. Some of the interesting issues that come up in this integration are around how R and Python (in particular pandas) differ in the way they represent data types and how pandera will handle the discrepancies between R data.frames and Pandas dataframes as data is passed back and forth between the two runtimes. However as the title suggests, why is this exercise highly unnecessary? Well, because R already has a lot of great data validation packages like `<a href=\"a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html&lt;/a\">validate<\/a>` and `<a href=\"a href=&quot;https://github.com/rich-iannone/pointblank&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rich-iannone/pointblank&lt;/a\">pointblank<\/a>`, and in fact pandera drew a lot of inspiration from these packages at its inception. Despite this redundancy, this talk will provide you with an understanding of how Pandera helps you reason about the schema of your data.frames and how reticulate can help you leverage some of its capabilities that may not be available in the native R data validation packages such as data synthesis for unit testing your data processing code.<\/p> <p><strong>About Niels:<\/strong><br/>Niels is the Chief Machine Learning Engineer at Union.ai, and core maintainer of Flyte, an open source workflow orchestration tool, author of UnionML, an MLOps framework for machine learning microservices, and creator of Pandera, a statistical typing and data testing tool for scientific data containers. His mission is to help data science and machine learning practitioners be more productive.<\/p> <p>He has a Masters in Public Health with a specialization in sociomedical science and public health informatics, and prior to that a background in developmental biology and immunology. His research interests include reinforcement learning, AutoML, creative machine learning, and fairness, accountability, and transparency in automated systems.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at <strong>7 PM America/New_York<\/strong> and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before.

Both in-person and virtual tickets are free, though we need a separate count for each for the venue.<\/p> <p><strong>About the Talk:<\/strong><br/>Rapid advances in mobile health (mHealth) technology are enabling unprecedented granularity into patient health status and disease experience. However, how to best handle the often complex patient-generated mHealth data requires several considerations so that we can derive meaningful insights. This is particularly important when working with populations that are at increased risk for health disparities and those who may be hard to reach. In this talk, Ipek will discuss some of these methodological issues in the context of her latest work with ecological momentary assessments to investigate daily patterns of physical activity, sleep and daily stressors among sexual and gender minority adults. She will focus on harmonizing longitudinal multi-modal data, functional data approaches, and special considerations for small sample sizes.<\/p> <p><strong>About Ipek:<\/strong><br/>Ipek is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Digital Health at Mount Sinai. She investigates mobile health (mHealth) and machine learning methods for complex patient-generated data toward improving chronic disease characterization and patient self-management. Her work is grounded in women’s reproductive health conditions (e.g., endometriosis) and populations at increased risk for health disparities. She is currently leading a NIH-funded project that aims to design digital patient reported outcome measures for improved real-time measurement and monitoring of chronic pain symptoms outside of the clinic. Ipek completed her doctorate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and post-doctoral training at Columbia University.<\/p> <p>The venue doors open at <strong>5:45 PM America/New_York<\/strong> where we continue <strong><a href=\"https://nyhackr.org/pizza.html?utm_source=nyhackr\">enjoying pizza<\/a><\/strong> together (we encourage the virtual audience to have pizza as well).

Every data scientist loves the part where they jump deep into modeling and statistical inference, but hates the part where they have to ingest, transform, and maintain data. This is a story of how I learned to embrace the analytics engineering part of the data science lifecycle, and how it has paid dividends in productionalizing ML models downstream. I will go in depth into Data Lakes, Lakehouses, and the basics of building dbt models, tests, and documentation. By the end of this talk you, too, will understand the value of Analytics Engineering, and have some tools to start your journey!<\/p> <p><strong>About Danya:<\/strong><br/>Danya Murali is a Data Scientist at Arcadia, a tech company using software and data to enable access to clean energy to decarbonize the grid. Formerly, she worked at the Energy Information Administration, the statistical hub of the Department of Energy. Her passion is in the intersection between Data, Climate, and DEI. She holds a Bachelors in Mathematics from UMBC and a Masters in Statistics from American University. When she’s not thinking about data and energy, she teaches all ages the joys of Bollywood and Indian Classical dance.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM America/New_York and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before.

An informed decision to invest in, acquire, or plan a trial for a new compound considers the likelihood the compound will reach regulatory approval along with downstream investments and future profits. However, drug development markets are still relatively inefficient, and sponsors lack tools and capabilities for evaluating development risk. In this talk I’ll provide an overview of the drug development space and show how we have been using publicly available data and R with our <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctrialsgov/index.html?utm_source=nyhackr\">ctrialsgov<\/a> package to quantify risk in the space.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Michael:<\/strong>\nMichael Kane is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Yale University along and Founder and Scientific Advisor at Telperian Inc.

Spatial data is no longer only in the hands of soil scientists, meteorologists, and criminologists, but in marketing, retail, finance, etc. It is common for spatial data to be treated as any other tabular data set. However, there is information to be drawn from our data's relation to space. The standard exploratory data analysis toolkit will not always suffice. In this talk I introduce the basics of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and the [{sfdep}](<a href=\"https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/?utm_source=nyhackr\" class=\"linkified\">https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/?utm_source=nyhackr<\/a>) package.

DuckDB is a new in-process database management system that runs directly in-process, greatly streamlining setup and data transfer. DuckDB uses a column-vectorized query processing architecture to run analytical SQL queries very quickly indeed. DuckDB can also directly query data that lives in R or Pandas data frames and from external files without a dedicated data importing step. DuckDB is available as Free and Open Source software. In my talk, I will describe the rationale behind building DuckDB as well as give some usage examples for statistical programming.<\/p> <p>About Hannes:<br/>Hannes Mühleisen is a Senior Researcher in the Database Architectures Group at CWI Amsterdam, the Dutch National Research Center for Computer Science and Mathematics.

The promise of cloud vendors is that it is easy with the cloud. The reality is often quite different. Recently, JD was faced with the problem of a recurring workflow that involves joining 35 billion records into a many-to-many join resulting in 75+ billion records and then collapsing that down to summary data. He grabbed a small team of developers and set out on a multi-week journey to figure out how to solve this workflow while minimizing runtime and costs. Some of the most important findings weren't just \"which platform to use?\" but, more importantly, \"how should a team think about this class of problem?\" This presentation will be light on R, and heavy on Amazon Web Services but will be of interest to anyone who's wondering what it takes to move billions of rows of data around efficiently.<\/p> <p>About JD:<br/>JD Long is co-author of The R Cookbook 2nd Edition and founder of the Chicago R User group.

Using the experimental {brochure} package by Colin Fay I was able to make a complex Shiny web service that lets R users order physical postcards of ggplots. I integrated Stripe for payments and used webhooks to know when to fulfill orders.

In this talk, I tour a variety of data science applications and apply a causal inference lens to them. Framing problems using causal language yields interesting insights into the nature of the work we do as scientists, and helps sharpen the goals, requirements, and risks of our projects. We show that beyond the more standard applications like A/B testing, some data science tasks can (perhaps surprisingly) be described as estimating causal quantities, and how this changes our models and their predictions.<\/p> <p>About Sean:<br/>Sean J. Taylor is a staff data scientist at Lyft's Rideshare Labs team, where he works on causal inference, experimentation, forecasting, and structural modeling. Previously, he led the applied statistics team in Facebook’s Core Data Science team.

It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin.

As extreme as they might sound, these quotes reveal one of the most important things when it comes to production-software: testing should be done as extensively as possible. Most R developers are already familiar with standard package testing, but things can get a little bit different when it comes to interactive web applications: what do we test, why, and how? In this talk, Colin will start by developing the good practices when it comes to testing Shiny, and present some of the tools you can use to test your own applications.<\/p> <p>About Colin:<br/>Colin Fay works at ThinkR, a French agency Focused on everything R-related. During the day, he helps companies to take full advantage of the power of R, by providing training, tools and infrastructure. His main areas of expertise are data &amp; software engineering, back-end &amp; infrastructure, and R in production. During the night, Colin is also a hyperactive open source developer and an open data advocate. You can find a lot of his work on his GitHub account (<a href=\"https://github.com/ColinFay\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ColinFay<\/a>) and on ThinkR's account (<a href=\"https://github.com/thinkr-open\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/thinkr-open<\/a>).

They're full of holes, rarely long enough but often too big, and they have a tendency to start and stop at inconvenient times and places. On top of this, the things these time series measure are inherently complex, the result of myriad interactions and processes operating throughout the biogeosphere.<\/p> <p>In this talk I'll discuss how we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate nonlinear spatio-temporal trends from these messy time series and illustrate the range of models and data types that we can handle with the mgcv and brms packages. I'll explain what modern GAMs are and how they learn from data, before moving on to demonstrate modern developments in GAMs that allow us to model entire conditional distributions rather than the usual focus on means and expectations. And as I'm a geographer, not a statistician, I plan to do this with pictures, not math.<\/p> <p>About Gavin:<\/p> <p>Gavin Simpson is a Research Scientist in the Institute of Environmental Change and Society at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. He is a #fakebiologist and a #fakestatistician, but he does have two degrees in Geography from University College London in the UK, though he doesn’t make many maps.<\/p> <p>Gavin's research is broadly concerned with how ecosystems and the communities of species they support change in time and space, from seconds to millennia, from ones backyard to globally. He's been using R since before v1.0 and has developed or maintains a number of R packages, including vegan, for multivariate data analyses, and gratia, a package for working with Generalized Additive Models, which feature in much of his research.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event early, details will be sent beforehand.

To effectively work with these series demands highly specialized tools--as dates, times, notation, calendars, time zones, and more must be carefully managed while doing even basic operations like subsetting, merging, aggregating and dealing with missingness. If not handled properly, all of your analysis could be at risk. Specialized tools for time have been part of R since the beginning, but have seen enormous changes over the last decade. In this talk we’ll explore where we started, what we have now and what might be on the horizon. I'll try to show the whole story in code and tell my unique perspective as someone who’s been lucky enough to be part of its history--and actively working on crafting its future for R, and beyond.<\/p> <p>About Jeff:<br/>Jeff Ryan is a practitioner in the quantitative hedge fund space and a long time contributor to R in both finance and data management. He introduced quantmod and xts in 2007, and co-founded the successful R/Finance conference, held annually since 2009. Over the years he's watched how time series went from an esoteric topic to the hottest thing in databases. He thinks this increased focus is only getting started. He's a bit opinionated, and enjoys building simple but powerful tools that can stand the test of time. Jeff is currently working on what he believes is be the next big step in time series management.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: Ludmila Janda <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/the-ggplot-glow-up_Ludmila-Janda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the ggplot glow-up: making lovely data visualizations in R<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yrZS8mGL-2E?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">Video<\/a> <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/264566290/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>It has been long time since we have done a ggplot talk so Luda will discuss packages that extend ggplot's functionality.<\/p> <p>Thank you to AT&amp;T Labs for hosting us.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>This talk will cover using ggplot and other ggplot-friendly packages in order to make impressive data visualizations with R.

The impact on our lives from these deep learning models is profoundly redefining consumer products and business processes. However, deep learning is a black box often using millions of activations.<\/p> <p>As a result, businesses that value explainability resist or do not leverage deep learning. For example, some risk, compliance and legal stakeholders resist using deep learning.

Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an iterative process of model building, inference, model checking and evaluation, and model expansion.

Note, this is a smaller space than usual for us so slots will fill up fast.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>Mining temporal-context data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of time formats: irregular or multiple time intervals, multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, heterogeneous data types and nested and crossed factors indicating hierarchical sub-groups. Time series models, in particular, the software supporting time series forecasting, makes strict assumptions on data that need to be provided, typically a matrix of numeric data with an implicit time index. Going from raw data to model-ready data is painful.<\/p> <p>This work presents a cohesive and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn flows into visualization and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are applied, and extended to temporal data: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout, (2) including an explicitly declared index variable representing time, (3) incorporating a \"key\" comprised of single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time, using a syntax-based and user-oriented approach in which it imposes nested or crossed structures on the data.<\/p> <p>This tidy data representation most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a \"data pipeline\" in time-based context. A sound data pipeline facilitates a fluent and transparent workflow for analyzing temporal data. Applications are included to illustrate tidy temporal data structure, data pipeline structure and usage. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the R package tsibble.<\/p> <p>About Earo:<\/p> <p>Earo is currently doing research on tidy data structure and visualisation of temporal-context data, as part of her PhD at Monash University.

In practice, however, overuse of the pipe tends to conflate two rather distinct operations: passing a value to a function versus composing functions. Burdening the pipe to handle both operations can lead to unnecessarily slow and rigid code.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll introduce a new tool for working with, and thinking about, function composition: the gestalt (<a href=\"https://github.com/egnha/gestalt\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/egnha/gestalt<\/a>) %&gt;&gt;&gt;%. It enriches the semantics of the familiar %&gt;% syntax with annotations and tidyverse quasiquotation. Using concrete examples, we'll explore how %&gt;&gt;&gt;% works, how it complements %&gt;%, and how you can use it to improve the malleability, transparency, and performance of your functions.<\/p> <p>As a highlight, we'll also see how %&gt;&gt;&gt;% enables you to treat values as objects with internal structure.

This classification and regression algorithm has proven itself very effective in many applications, and is robust as well as easy to use. In this talk we will briefly explain what the algorithm is. We discuss on an intuitive level what is needed for ensemble methods to work, and how random forests achieve that. Comparison will be made with other tree ensemble methods such as boosting. Based on the intuition, we will discuss possibilities for tuning random forests for better performance. We will also touch on how the variable importance idea that Breiman introduced in random forests can be applied to other Machine Learning methods.<\/p> <p>About Andy:<\/p> <p>Andy Liaw is a Senior Principal Scientist in Biometrics Research, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., where he applies statistics and machine learning to complex chemical and biological data to address problems in drug discovery.

This talk reviews the work in this area that capitalizes on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, an algorithm that embeds a tree-based machine learning technique within a Bayesian framework to allow for flexible estimation and valid assessments of uncertainty. It will further describe extensions of the original work to address common issues in causal inference: lack of common support, violations of the ignorability assumption, and generalizability of results to broader populations. It will also describe existing R packages for traditional BART implementation as well as debut a new R package for causal inference using BART, bartCause.<\/p> <p>About Jennifer:<\/p> <p>Jennifer Hill (<a href='https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Jennifer_L_Hill' class='linkified'>https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Jennifer_L_Hill<\/a>) works on development of methods that help us to answer the causal questions that are so vital to policy research and scientific development. In particular, she focuses on situations in which it is difficult or impossible to perform traditional randomized experiments, or when even seemingly pristine study designs are complicated by missing data or hierarchically structured data. Most recently Hill has been pursuing two major strands of research. The first focuses on Bayesian nonparametric methods that allow for flexible estimation of causal models without the need for methods such as propensity score matching. The second line of work pursues strategies for exploring the impact of violations of typical assumptions in this work that require that all confounders have been measured. Hill has published in a variety of leading journals including Journal of the American Statistical Association, Annals of Applied Statistics, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Public Health, Political Analysis, and Developmental Psychology.

Due to the current ubiquity of data (Big Data), and availability of on demand, inexpensive, and parallel hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on Amazon EC2, Deep Learning has revitalized the excitement in Artificial Intelligence. Breakthrough results can be seen in industry applications such as computer vision, robotics, healthcare, security, retail, and more. <a href='http://mxnet.io/'>Apache MXNet<\/a> is an open-source, fully-featured, flexibly-programmable and ultra-scalable deep learning framework supporting state-of-the-art deep models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). MXNet enables Data Scientists familiar with the R programing language to train and deploy deep models at scale, using their favorite language, with the same fast performance observed by Python, Scala or C++ ML practitioners.<\/p> <p><br/>Participants will learn how to spin up a pre-built, GPU enabled Data Science environment using the AWS Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image (<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB'>AMI<\/a>), in few minutes. We will write a deep learning program with MXNet in a few lines of codes using the R programming language. We will discuss training deep learning models on one or multiple GPUs via R. Finally, we will compare deep models to some traditional Machine Learning models such as penalized regression and boosted trees.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Dan:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://twitter.com/dmbanga'>Dan Romuald Mbanga<\/a> is a Business Development Management Lead for <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/'>AWS AI<\/a> platforms.

In this talk, I'll describe two real-world examples of this problem, and then will describe a Bayesian approach that combines a prior distribution with a (mostly) principled, statistically honest extrapolation method. A key piece of this approach is a class of semiparametric regression models called GAMLSS--Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape. These models can flexibly describe the shapes of the priors and temporal accumulation functions, and allow posterior predictive intervals that become more precise over time as information accumulates. This is important for nontechnical users of business predictions--the inevitable errors in overly precise predictions lead quickly to mistrust. I'll also compare the approach with classic time series forecasting techniques and with dynamic linear models.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Harlan:<\/b><\/p> <p>Harlan Harris has a PhD in Computer Science/Machine Learning from the <a href='http://illinois.edu/'>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<\/a>, and worked as a Cognitive Psychology researcher at <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University<\/a> and <a href='http://www.nyu.edu/'>NYU<\/a> before turning to industry.

This package provides a visualization platform for creating and viewing large interactive \"small multiple\" displays, also known as Trellis or faceted displays. With small multiple displays, the data is split into groups and a plot is made for each group, with the resulting plots arranged in a grid. This approach is simple but very effective for displaying and discovering interesting patterns in data and is an essential visualization approach in the data scientist’s toolbox. TrelliscopeJS enables small multiple displays to come alive by providing the ability to interactively navigate a potentially extremely large number of plots. The TrelliscopeJS package integrates with common R workflows such as ggplot2 and the \"tidyverse\", and produces easy-to-share interactive web-based visualizations.

In August I did a <a href='http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/'>statistical analysis<\/a> that helped crack the code--Trump tweets himself from an Android, while his campaign staff tweets from an iPhone.

To this end, I've developed a number of packages that make individual parts of the process easier (<a href='http://ggplot2.org/'>ggplot2<\/a> for visualisation, <a href='https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html'>dplyr<\/a> for data manipulation, <a href='https://github.com/hadley/tidyr'>tidyr<\/a> for data tidying, ...). Recently I've been thinking more about how the pieces fit together. In the words of <a href='https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1535'>Hal Abelson<\/a>, \"No matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines the power of the system.\"<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss the idea of the <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse'>tidyverse<\/a>, a set of conventions that ties together disparate package to provide a uniform interface for doing data science.

Understanding how the rubber generates forces between the car and the road requires complex physics and tons of data. Tire testing is extremely expensive, and as a result, testing more variables results in less steps within each variable. Students in Formula SAE usually solve the resulting multi-dimensional interpolation problem with Pacekja's famous \"magic formula.\" The \"magic formula\" requires finding the best fit of a 20 formula system of equations, so most Formula SAE members use proprietary software packages that do all the math for them.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I explain what is needed in tires to make a racecar go fast, and how I used non-parametric and semi-parametric regression methods as an alternative means to solve the interpolation problem. K-Nearest regression, thin-plate smoothing plots and ggplot2 are showcased as means of analyzing data that has more than 3 dimensions.<\/p> <p><b>About Matthew<\/b>:<br/>Matthew grew up in San Antonio, Texas, where he and his dad worked on motorcycles and old cars.

The code will most likely be more consistent, more stable, and easier to maintain. However, sometimes, especially for exploratory data science projects, it can be more effective or efficient to mix and match. For instance, consider the situation where you want to make use of a fast machine-learning library. It turns out that this library is written in C++, but you work in R, and there are no language bindings available yet. Or consider the situation where you previously solved a certain problem in R, and now you need to solve that same problem again for a Python-based project.<\/p> <p>In this talk I discuss three approaches to become a polyglot data scientist. First, I demonstrate Beaker Notebook, which allows you to use multiple languages (Python, R, JavaScript, Julia, etc.) in one notebook. Second, I show several ways of combining programming languages (e.g., how to load R data into MATLAB, how to use a MATLAB package in Python, and how to call Python functions from R). This list of combinations is not exhaustive, but it will give you a good idea of the possibilities. Third, I explain how to write your own reusable command-line tools and employ command-line tools directly from Python and R. The command line is language agnostic, which means that you can combine tools written in just about any language. With a few simple steps, it s possible to turn your existing code into a command-line tool.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Jeroen:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jeroen Janssens is an assistant professor of data science at Tilburg University.

Two common examples are in time-series work, where the data are not independent and dependencies need to be modeled explicitly, and in causal research, where consistent estimates of the parameters themselves are the primary object of interest. Jim will discuss the usefulness of the Random Forest's proximity matrix in this sort of work. He will present two new methods: <\/p> <p>- <b>Proximity matching: <\/b>A technique for building synthetic control groups for causal analysis on observational data. This method largely overcomes both the dimensionality issues and Smith-Todd critique of other matching methods.<\/p> <p>- <b>Analogy weighting: <\/b>A method for constructing weights to use in time-series models. This weighting scheme allows researchers to give weight to relevant periods of history and ignore irrelevant periods.

The field is still in the early phases of development, yet depending on the resources and risk tolerance of a fund, multiple approaches abound to participate in this new paradigm.<\/p> <p>A key technical challenge of the alternative data field is the œsmall sample problem of big data. Quite often, œquantamental research is creating models aiming to predict GAAP operational metrics such as revenues. Unfortunately, most companies only announce those numbers once every 3 months. Thus, even if a potentially exciting dataset has only a few years worth of back data, then a company specific model will have just 8-12 data points to work with. This greatly diminishes an analysts ability to create a sensible model out of unstructured data.<\/p> <p>We will discuss some of the solutions to this problem though informed interpolation with R and Quandl (a novel approach) as well as a general discussion of the application of data science techniques in alternative data research within the financial context.<\/p> <p>To learn more about alternative data, see a recent white paper published by the speaker: <a href='http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/'><a href='http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/\" class=\"linkified'>http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br/><b>About Gene<\/b>:<\/p> <p>Gene Ekster works with asset management firms and data providers in a consulting capacity to help integrate alternative data into the investment process.

Over time a fluent interface retreats to your subconscious. You don't need to bring it to mind; the code just flows out of your fingers. I strive for this fluency in all the packages I write, and while I don't always succeed, I think I've learned some valuable lessons along the way.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss three guidelines that make it easier to develop fluent interfaces:<b><br/><\/b><\/p> <p> <b>Pure functions<\/b>. A pure function only interacts with the world through its inputs and outputs; it has no side-effects. Pure functions make great building blocks because they're are easy to reason about and can be easily composed.<\/p> <p> <b>Predictable interfaces<\/b>. It's easier to learn a function if it's consistent, because you can learn the behaviour of a whole group of functions at once. I'll highlight the benefits of predictability with some of my favourite R \"WAT\"s (including `c()`, `sapply()` and `sample()`).<\/p> <p> <b>Pipes<\/b>. Pure predictable functions are nice in isolation but are most powerful in combination. The pipe, `%&gt;%`, is particularly in important when combining many functions because it turns function composition on its head so you can read it from left-to-right. I'll show you how this has helped me build dplyr, rvest, ggvis, lowliner, stringr and more.<\/p> <p>This talk will help you make best use of my recent packages, and teach you how to apply the same principles to make your own code easier to use.<\/p> <p><b>About Hadley<\/b>:<\/p> <p><br/><a href='http://had.co.nz/'>Hadley<\/a> is Chief Scientist at <a href='http://www.rstudio.com/'>RStudio<\/a> and a member of the <a href='https://www.r-project.org/foundation/'>R Foundation<\/a>.

In addition to demonstrating shinyStan we'll also discuss the importance of making tools for model exploration (visualizing, checking and diagnosing, comparing, inferring and predicting) easier to use and more integrated with software for model building and computation.<\/p> <p>Most applied Bayesian data analysis requires employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain samples from the posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Diagnosing convergence, checking the fit of the model, and producing graphical and numerical summaries of the parameters of interest is an important but often laborious process that slows the down the creative and exploratory process of model building.<\/p> <p>shinyStan, a package for R and Shiny app, is designed to facilitate this process in two primary ways: <\/p> <p><br/>1) Providing interactive visual model exploration:<\/p> <p>shinyStan provides immediate, informative, customizable visual and numerical summaries of model parameters and convergence diagnostics for MCMC simulations. Although SHINYstan was initially envisioned to be a companion to the <a href='http://mc-stan.org/rstan.html'>RStan<\/a> package (the R interface to the Stan programming language for Bayesian statistical inference), it can also be used to explore the output from any other program (e.g. Jags, Bugs, SAS) or any user-written MCMC algorithm.<\/p> <p>\n\n2) Making saving and sharing more convenient:<\/p> <p>shinyStan allows you to store the basic components of an entire project (code, posterior samples, graphs, tables, notes) in a single object. Users can also export graphics into their R sessions as ggplot2 objects for further customization and easy integration in reports or post-processing for publication. <\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About Jonah:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jonah Gabry is a graduate student at <a href='http://stat.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University<\/a> studying statistics and concentrating on applications in the social sciences.

The buy-side quants aren t the only ones in on the action, in fact, most stat-arb shops are late to the party. Roughly defined, financial alternative data is the œbig data which doesn't arise from the financial system itself, i.e. not equity stock price / volume data, order book, analyst estimates or info from the SEC filings, etc. It is data from the broader world around us, online transactions, brick and mortar purchases, POS systems, clickstreams and the like. We're going to walk though a few examples of how noisy, unstructured data become an investable signal using tools such as text mining with latent dirichlet allocation. We will show R code for paneling longitudinal data and discuss procedures for reducing bias in these data. However, overall this talk is going to be slightly less technical, with the aim of introducing the audience to the process of how hedge fund portfolio managers and sell-side research analysts are systematically generating returns by leveraging unique primary (bots / scrapers, channel checks) and third party datasets (including data brokers). This includes sourcing, compliance, scrubbing out PII, alpha generation related to revenue estimates and approaches to balance the secret sauce with product transparency.

Reinforcement learning concerns problems with sequences of decisions (where each decision affects subsequent opportunities), in which the effects can be uncertain, and with potentially long-term goals. It has achieved immense success in various different fields, especially AI/Robotics and Operations Research, by providing a framework for learning from interactions with an environment and feedback in the form of rewards and penalties. <\/p> <p><br/>Shane will give a general overview of the subject of reinforcement learning, covering how to solve cases where there is uncertainty both in actions and states, as well as where the state space is very large.

We play with streams of data coming from electronic sensors attached to our computers, and we watch streams of data from sensors elsewhere in the world. We think consuming data like this--in real time, not in batch--is going to become more and more common in the future, and so decided to explore what working with streams might look like.<\/p> <p>The result of our exploration is a project called œstreamtools (<a href='http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/'><a href='http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/\" class=\"linkified'>http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/<\/a><\/a>)--an open-source, graphical toolkit for dealing with streams of data. In this talk I m going to introduce streamtools and what it can do, and I m going to use streamtools to talk about the future of data science. I d like you to come away wanting to use (and maybe even contribute to) streamtools, and to think about how using streams challenges your assumptions about what analysis and reporting can be.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Mike:<\/p> <p><a href='http://mikedewar.org/'>Mike Dewar<\/a> is a Data Scientist at the New York Times R&amp;D Lab.

(2) It does so with few preconceptions. And (3) it can handle at least dozens, maybe hundreds of variables. <\/p> <p>However, if approached in a naive fashion, data analysis having these three features triggers a \"combinatorial explosion\": The output from the analysis can include thousands, maybe millions of numbers. Few methods exist possessing all three features yet which avoid the combinatorial explosion. Ellis has devised a data analytic method he calls \"Concurrence Topology (CT)\" which does so.<\/p> <p>CT takes an apparently radically new approach to solving this problem. It starts by translating data into a \"filtration\", a series of \"shapes\". The shapes in the series are called \"frames.\" A filtration is like a building. The frames are like floors of the building. But while the floors of a building are two-dimensional, the frames of a filtration can have dimension much higher than two.<\/p> <p>A filtration can have holes that are like elevator shafts in a building. Such holes indicate relatively weak or negative association among the variables. CT uses computational algebraic topology to describe the pattern of holes. Normally, there are no more than a few dozen holes, so CT avoids the combinatorial explosion. Often one can identify small groups of variables that are closely associated with a given hole. This process facilitates interpretation of the hole. <\/p> <p>A limitation of CT is that, so far, it only works with binary data. But quantitative data can always be binarized.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nAbout Steve:<\/p> <p>Steve Ellis wrote software in R (available upon request) implementing Concurrence Topology. A paper, written by Arno Klein and Ellis, introducing CT and demonstrating it on fMRI data has been accepted by a topology journal.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPizza begins at 6:15, announcements, giveaways and the talk start at 7, followed by the local bar.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: Michael Kane <br><b>Slides<\/b>: Not available <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/183436592/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>This month we have Michael Kane from Yale discussing knowledge discovery in the biomedical sciences.<\/p> <p>Thank you again to Misha Lisovich and the <a href='https://foursquare.com/v/iheartradio-theater-new-york-ny/4b032755f964a5200f4d22e3'>iHeartRadio Theater<\/a> for hosting us.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout the talk:<\/p> <p>Electronic access to current, scientific literature is essential to continued discovery and progress in the biomedical sciences. The online literature provides for the efficient dissemination of published knowledge and has become ever more convenient, thanks to public databases such as PubMed. However there has been little change in the basic way we electronically search for information, i.e. by keyword-based queries and manual scanning of the returned titles and abstracts. This talk outlines my current efforts for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to integrate higher-level, semantic approaches to understand the relational structure of articles in scientific corpuses. I will place heavy emphasis on computational principles developed to address the challenge of creating an \"augmented knowledge discover engine\" that allows individual researchers to understand the landscape of relevant data in their subject area. The long-term goal of this project is to provide new perspectives on the current literature and identify new, potentially untapped areas for scientific discovery. <\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Michael:<\/p> <p>Michael Kane is part of the Biostatistics Faculty at Yale University. His research interests are in the areas of scalable computational learning, augmented knowledge discovery, and stochastic approximation. He is the 2010 winner of the American Statistical Association's Chambers Statistical Software Award for the Bigmemory Project, a set of software libraries that allow the R programming environment to scale to terabyte-scale data. In 2011 he was awarded a grant on DARPA's XDATA project, part of the White House's Big Data Initiative for design and implementation of an elastic, distributed computing framework. <\/p> <p><br/>In 2012 he was was the recipient of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation s Grand Challenge Round 11 Award for the semantic clustering of medical and academic literature.

Such transformation can bring both joy and pain; in biology, for example, this pain was experienced in the 1990s with the sequencing of whole organisms. Much of that experience---such as the demands for novel collaborations across previously-separated communities, and the opportunity to create new strategies for attacking the core questions of the discipline---has close parallels in both communities. I'll use our time together to share some ways re-framing domain questions as machine learning tasks has opened up new avenues for understanding both in academic research and in real-world applications.

The application of network science and graphical modelling has been instrumental in these analyses and enabled the examination of the brain as an integrated system. In this talk, I will outline some novel data-driven statistical methods that estimate the dynamic connectivity or networks between pre-defined brain regions using ideas from graphical models and time series analysis. I will also address the challenge of estimating a group-level dynamic connectivity structure across subjects. Finally, I will discuss the application of these new methods to simulated vector autoregression (VAR) data, to single-subject and multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from task-related and resting-state experiments as well as to Electroencephalography (EEG) data from a subject with epilepsy. Techniques that will be discussed include: working with fMRI and EEG data, graphical lasso, stationary bootstrap, and Granger Causality.

The goals are the following: (1) Provide the data analyst with methods and a computational environment that enable study of large data with almost the same comprehensiveness and detail that we can small data. (2) The analyst uses an interactive language for data analysis that is both highly flexible and enables highly time-efficient programming with the data.(3) Underneath the language, a distributed database and parallel compute engine makes computation feasible and practical, and is easily addressable from within the language. (4) The environment provides access to the 1000s of analytic methods of statistics, machine learning, and visualization.(5) Get a reasonable first system going right away.<\/p> <p><br/>In D&amp;R, the analyst divides the data into subsets. Computationally,each subset is a small dataset. The analyst applies analytic methods to each of the subsets, and the outputs of each method are recombined to form a result for the entire data. Computations can be run in parallel with almost no communication among them, making them nearly embarrassingly parallel, the simplest possible parallel processing.One of our D&amp;R research thrusts uses statistics to develop ``best''division and recombination methods for analytic methods. This is critical because the division and recombination methods have an immense impact on the statistical accuracy of the D&amp;R result for an analytic method. Another thrust is a D&amp;R computational environment that has two widely used components, the R interactive environment for data analysis,and the Hadoop distributed database and parallel compute engine. Our RHIPE merger of them passes the embarrassingly parallel D&amp;R computations off to Hadoop. The analyst programs this wholly from within R, insulated from the complexity of distributed database management and parallel computation.<\/p> <p>About Bill Cleveland:<\/p> <p>William S. Cleveland is the Shanti S. Gupta Distinguished Professor ofStatistics and Courtesy Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University.<\/p> <p>His areas of methodological research are in statistics, machine learning,and data visualization. He has analyzed data sets ranging from small tolarge and complex in his research in cyber security, computer networking,visual perception, environmental science, healthcare engineering, publicopinion polling, and disease surveillance.<\/p> <p>In the course of this work, Cleveland has developed many new methods and modelsfor data that are widely used throughout the worldwide technical community. Hehas led teams developing software systems implementing his methods that havebecome core programs in many commercial and open-source systems.<\/p> <p>In 1996 Cleveland was chosen national Statistician of the Year by the ChicagoChapter of the American Statistical Association. In 2002 he was selected asa Highly Cited Researcher by the American Society for Information Science &amp;Technology in the newly formed mathematics category. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American Association of the Advancement of Science, and the International Statistical Institute.<\/p> <p>Today, Cleveland and colleagues are developing the Divide &amp; Recombine approach to large complex data. Each analytic method is applied independently to each subset in a division of the data into subsets. Then outputs are recombined. Thisenables a data analyst to carry out detailed, comprehensive analysis of bigdata, to use only the R interactive software environment, and to easily run analytic methods in parallel. This is achieved through (1) statistics research to find D&amp;R division and recombination methods that give high statistical accuracy; (2) development of a D&amp;R computational environment that merges R with the Hadoop distributed database and distributed parallel compute engine.<\/p> <p><br/>Pizza begins at 6:30, the talks at 7 and then we will go to a nearby bar.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: John Myles White <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Online-Active-LearningData-Streams_John-Myles-White.html\" target=\"_blank\">Online/Active Learning + Data Streams<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEn6uvhgBcM?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">Video<\/a> <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/137465262/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>We have an amazing two-for this month, John Myles White and Tal Galili.<\/p> <p>First up we have Tal:<\/p> <p>Creating beautiful trees of clusterings with R (+a bonus)<\/p> <p><br/><a href='http://r-statistics.com/'>Tal Galili<\/a>, the founder of <a href='http://r-bloggers.com'>R-bloggers<\/a> (and also a PhD student of statistics), will present his recent work on the package \"<a href='http://github.com/talgalili/dendextend'>dendextend<\/a>\" - intended for visualizing and comparing trees of heirarchical clusterings (a.k.a: dendrograms) with R.<\/p> <p>There will be a short overview of the \"dendrogram\" object in R and its manipulation with the \"dendextend\" package.

Bloomberg Sports Head of Broadcast Rob Shaw looks to tackle that question. Once limited to a niche of quant-minded sports enthusiasts, sabermetrics is now a bustling industry brought to the mainstream after the publishing of Moneyball by Michael Lewis in 2003. Shaw will explain the challenges of bringing in-depth analytics to the mainstream audience in sports and how the second-screens such as iPads and smart phones will likely figure into its future.<\/p> <p>Shaw's background is in sports broadcasting and after earning his MBA at NYU Stern, he transitioned to business development at Bloomberg Sports.<\/p> <p>Please note the new location for this meetup.

As organizations and businesses become more data-driven, EDA becomes increasingly important. In large organizations, sharing derived data, experiments, graphics and visualizations is still a hard problem, and is addressed mainly by stand-alone version-control systems. In contrast, we envision a system where users collaborate with each other fluidly, moving from a full-fledged R command prompt to integrated code search among all users to a simplified \"pick your analysis, visualization and data\" view. In this environment, sharing a new dataset, analysis or visualization should be as easy as creating it. We will show the current state of the tool via live demos.<\/p> <p>As always there will be pizza starting at 6:15pm, though this time we will be trying something a little different. Most people in this group know my affinity for pizza. So for each meetup we are going to order from a different place and we ask that you answer a quick poll (probably through the Meetup iOS/Android app) on how you like the pizza.

We are delighted to welcome <a href='http://karpinski.org/'>Stefan Karpinski<\/a>, one of the creators of Julia, to give an introduction to the language and his perspective on statistical computing.<\/p> <p>Julia is a general-purpose, high-level, dynamic language in the tradition of Lisp, Perl, Python and Ruby. It is designed to take advantage of modern techniques for executing dynamic languages with statically-compiled performance. As part of this design, the language has an expressive type system, which programmers may leverage for dispatch and error checking incidentally providing the compiler with useful type information. Using types is entirely optional, however: \"typeless Julia\" is a valid and useful subset of the language, similar to traditional dynamic languages, which nevertheless runs at statically compiled speeds.\\<\/p> <p>Julia is especially good at running Matlab and R-style programs. Given its level of performance, we envision a new era of technical computing where libraries can be developed in a high-level language instead of C or Fortran. We have also experimented with cloud API integration, and begun to develop a web-based interactive computing environment. The ultimate goal is to make cloud-based supercomputing as easy and accessible as Google Docs.<\/p> <p>We will also hear from a mix of people who have already started developing in Julia and see some examples of what they have developed.<\/p> <p>The meetup will follow our typical schedule: pizza will begin at 6:15pm, Stefan will begin promptly at 7pm, and we will head to The Central Bar around 8:30pm.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: Nicholas Petraco <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Applications-of-R-in-Forensic-Science_Nicholas-Petraco.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Applications of R in Forensic Science<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/47948242/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>This month we are pleased to welcome Nicholas Petraco to discuss the application of statistical computing to crime scene forensics. Yeah, that's right, <b>we're getting all CSI in February!<\/b><\/p> <p>The practice of qualitative physical evidence comparison in forensic science has come under great scrutiny since the 2009 publication of the NAS report on œStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States . From a computational point of view, œevidence from a crime is simply data. Modern machine learning techniques can make associations between data samples from a suspect, and evidence from a crime scene quantitative and objective. Specifically, given multivariate data constituting evidence in a crime, how likely is it that a conclusion of association with a suspect is erroneous?<\/p> <p>This presentation will discuss how our group of forensic researchers and practitioners are using R to be able to answer this question. Projects discussed will be on the use of principal component analysis (PCA), canonical variate analysis (CVA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), resampling, conformal prediction theory (CPT) and empirical Bayes methods to establish identification systems and estimated error rates on firearms and tool mark evidence, dust discrimination, fire debris evidence, footwear associations and questioned photocopier analysis.<\/p> <p><br/><i>Speaker Bio<\/i>: Nicholas D.

Data cleaning is not only a vital first step, but it is oftenrepeated multiple times over the course of an analysis as new problems come to light. Despite the amount of time it takes up, there has been little research on how to do clean data well. Part of the challenge is the breadth of activities that cleaning encompasses, from outlier checking to date parsing to missing value imputation. To get a handle on the problem, this talk focusses on a small, but important, subset of data cleaning that I call data \"tidying'\": getting the data in a format that is easy to manipulate, model, and visualise. <\/p> <p>In this talk you'll see some of the crazy data sets that I've struggled with over the years, and learn the basic tools for making messy data tidy. I'll also discuss tidy tools, tools that take tidy data as input and return tidy data as output. The idea of a tidy tool is useful for critiquing existing R functions, and will help to explain why some tasks that seem like they should be easy are in fact quite hard.

From PyMC's website:<\/p> <p><i>Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However, few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are non-trivial to code by hand. PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.<\/i><\/p> <p>You'll note that this presentation <b>does not directly involve R<\/b>, and there are a couple of reasons for this:<\/p> <p><br/>Chris has greatly contributed to the statistical computing community, and we are lucky to have him<br/>Given the <a href='http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/09/ross_ihaka_to_r.html'>recent consternation within the R community<\/a> about the language, it is valuable to understand how other languages approach statistical computing<br/>We always say the R meetup is the satellite Python meetup, and now we can make that official.

The talk will draw on recent experiences with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the design of a six-week data analysis unit within a year-long computer science curriculum. While the talk is framed around problems related to teaching, it involves themes and data types that are not typically discussed in an introductory statistics class.<\/p> <p>Broadly, the unit is designed as a kind of \"participatory sensing\" exercise. Participatory sensing is a variation on traditional embedded sensing that enlists the efforts of the general public to collect and analyze data. In our case, Google has generously donated a number of G2 phones that students use to capture geo-tagged and timestamped observations. From a practical perspective, the talk surveys R packages for representing, visualizing and modeling data on time and location, as well as images and text. Students in the unit learn a kind of story telling with fairly complex data -- An activity that is not entirely distinct from traditional statistics, but, given the unit's position within a computer science course, emphasizes computation over mathematics, information technology and the \"mechanics of data\" over probability and analytical approximations.<\/p> <p>Finally, Mark will discuss how this work has been extended to other outlets for this kind of story telling, and include a presentation of a number of public art works that draw on data feeds. These include Moveable Type, a permanent artwork in the lobby of the New York Times Building; and <a href='http://stewdio.org/work/terrenatale/'>Terre Natale<\/a>, and a recent commission by the Cartier Foundation on the theme of global migration.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: Andrew Little <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Game-Theory-Problem_Andrew-Little.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Game Theory Problem<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: Andrew Little <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Game-Theory-Code_Andrew-Little.r\" target=\"_blank\">Game Theory Code<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: Andrew Ilardi <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Portfolio-Correlation-Analysis-Tool_Andrew-Ilardi.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Portfolio Correlation Analysis Tool<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: Jared Lander <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/New-York-Pizza-How-to-Find-the-Best_Jared-Lander.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">New York Pizza How to Find the Best<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: Pankaj Chopra <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Biomarker-Detection-in-Cancer-(Gene-Expression-Analysis)_Pankaj-Chopra.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Biomarker Detection in Cancer (Gene Expression Analysis)<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: Pankaj Chopra <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Biomarker-Detection-in-Cancer-(Gene-Expression-Analysis)-Code_Pankaj-Chopra.r\" target=\"_blank\">Biomarker Detection in Cancer (Gene Expression Analysis) Code<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><br><b>Speaker<\/b>: John Myles White <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Analysis-of-Functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Images-in-R_John-Myles-White.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Images in R<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/12848628/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>Thanks again to Shane for suggesting this meetup topic!<\/p> <p><b>UPDATE<\/b>: Before the applications talks begin, we will be hearing from Geoff Lewis of <a href='https://www.topguest.com/gate'>TopGuest.com<\/a> about his start-up, their data, and opportunities to join their team.<\/p> <p>This meetup with cover several examples of how R can be used across a wide range of research fields.

Andrew Little and Drew Conway of the Department of Politics at NYU will present a brief overview of a few of the most useful packages in this space.<\/p> <p><b>Econometrics<\/b><br/>Andrew will discuss two econometric packages developed by Gary King of Harvard, and how he has used them in his research.<\/p> <p><a href='http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/'>Zelig<\/a> - a single, easy-to-use package that can estimate, help interpret, and present the results of a large range of statistical methods.<br/><a href='http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/'>MatchIt<\/a> - implements a wide range of sophisticated matching methods, making it possible to greatly reduce the dependence of causal inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, statistical modeling assumptions.<\/p> <p><br/><b>Social Network Analysis<\/b><br/>Drew will discuss network analysis in R and provide a an overview of how to perform it through example.

For datasets larger than RAM, or for computationally intensive operations this can be quite limiting. There are a number of approaches used to break through the barriers imposed by running R on a single machine. The High Performance Computing view on CRAN provides an overview of some of these techniques: <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html'>http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Presentations:<\/p> <p><br/>Shane Conway - Best practices for efficient code in R<br/>John Myles White - Using R in a clustered environment with SNOW / Rmpi<br/>David Rosenberg - HadoopStreaming package<br/>Steve Weston - REvolution Computing's foreach and iterator optimized code.<\/p>","<b>Speaker<\/b>: Joshua Reich <br><b>Slides<\/b>: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.blob.core.windows.net/presentations/Machine-Learning-in-R_Joshua-Reich.r\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning in R<\/a> <br><b>Video link<\/b>: - <br><b>MeetUp link<\/b>: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/9940940/?utm_source=nyhackr\" target=\"_blank\">MeetUp<\/a> <br><hr style='background: #a3a3a3; height: 1px;'><p>This first meeting will be your opportunity to help shape the direction for this group.<\/p> <p>With recent exposure in the NY Times, R is become less of an obscure tool confined to academia. The R-SIG-Finance list is full of New Yorkers who apply R in financial settings. Inside Google, Facebook and other data intensive companies, R plays an important role in helping analysts understand ecosystems.<\/p> <p>And R can be a lot of fun to use too. A powerful, and sometimes painful, mix of functional, imperative and object-oriented programming - the learning curve is steep and many things don't work as one would expect. Given this, I find it terribly useful to keep in touch with other R programmers as I'm always learning new tricks and improving my skills.<\/p> <p>Meeting Agenda:<\/p> <p>1. Introduction to R<br/>2.
